## Arduino Persian Reshaper
Reconstruct Persian/Arabic letters to be used in Arduino IDE and OLED/LCD display. This script is applicable to all Arduino family boards such as ESP8266/ESP32, Particle Photon, ....
All displays that can be set to ```pixel(x, y, color)``` can be used.

## Description
Persian/Arabic script is very special with two essential features:
1. It is written from right to left.
2. The characters change shape according to their surrounding characters.

## Installation
First you need to install the [Adafruit GFX library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library) Then according to the type of display, install the library you need. Here I used the 128x64 display with SSD1306 chip driver So I installed the [Adafruit SSD1306] (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306) library.
